# Poker Dice
## Introduction
Dice Poker is a simple game with a quick pace. The game is inspired by the well-known card version of Poker. Dice Poker is played with five dice, which have different figures (Ace, King, Queen.. etc). The goal of the game is to roll the highest combination possible. Compared to the card version of Poker there is no element of bluffing.

### Rules
The number of players of the Dice Poker is not limited. Each player wagers the same amount of money, the highest poker combination/hand takes it all. The first player rolls five dice. If the player likes the hand they may decide to keep it, or re-roll them individually. The rule applies to all players. 

It may happen in the situation when the first player thinks it is going to be difficult for other players to overcome their  dice Poker combination. Generally the number of rolls is set according to the first player.

The first player can keep a specific hand if they are satisfied – for example three kings, then he or she rolls the remaining two dice. After the player finishes the round they hand over the dice to the next player. The variation with two rounds is the most usual. However the players can agree upon the third roll. Again the highest hand wins.

If two or more players have an equal combination, then the winner is determined by the next roll with five dice.
