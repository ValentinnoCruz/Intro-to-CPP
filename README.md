# CSC 05: Programming Concepts and Methodology I: C++ 
Introduction to the fundamentals of problem definition, algorithm development, and structured programming logic for business, scientific and mathematical applications. The C++ language will be used for programming problems.

## Course Objective
Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:

1. Describe the software development life-cycle

2. Describe the principles of structured programming and be able to design, implement and test structured programs.

3. Explain what an algorithm is and its importance in computer programming.

4. Summarize the evolution of programming languages illustrating how this history has led to the paradigms available today.

5. Use pseudo-code, flowcharts, and a programming language to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving problems. Identify the information requirements, synthesize the algorithmic steps needed to transform the data input into the required output information, and organize the output format to facilitate user communication.

6. Demonstrate different forms of binding, visibility, scoping, and lifetime management.

7. Create computer programs using the principles of structured programming and demonstrate the use of an IDE with appropriate libraries. Design, implement, test, and debug programs that use fundamental programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, and functions.

8. Apply the principles of logical and programming concepts to develop solutions for gaming, business, scientific and mathematical problems.
